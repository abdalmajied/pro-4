            <p class="text-secondary py-2">These days, there are a lot resources out there for learning how to code. And many of them are readily available online for free ‚Äì so choosing one can be overwhelming </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">But there‚Äôs definitely an upside: you don‚Äôt need to attend a paid bootcamp or university anymore in order to learn how to code. You can teach yourself.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">In this article, I will share some tips and info about how to learn to code for free as a beginner. I‚Äôll also point you to free learning platforms and resources. </p> 
            <h2 class="py-4">What is Coding?</h2>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">‚ÄúCoding‚Äù is a commonly used term for computer programming. Some people use it interchangeably with programming, while others would argue they are not entirely the same. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> By definition, ‚Äúcode‚Äù refers to a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Computers don‚Äôt understand human language, so over time, humans have created languages that computers can understand. And developers speak to them through those languages.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> Examples of coding languages include HTML, GitHub Markdown, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, among many others.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> When you learn how to code, you‚Äôll be able to write instructions for computers to follow. This lets you make websites, applications, and software, and do some other cool stuff.</p>

            <h2 class="py-4">What is Programming?</h2>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">If coding is the act of writing instructions for a computer to follow, what then is programming? </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">Many developers view programming as a more advanced term than coding, and a lot of others use both words interchangeably. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">Programming still involves writing instructions for the computer to follow, but now data structures and algorithms are important. Some coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Markdown don‚Äôt use algorithms and data structures, while others such as JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++ use them heavily. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> This brings up a distinction that many developers make. In the web development industry, many developers don‚Äôt consider HTML to be a ‚Äúprogramming language‚Äù in a strict sense, because it doesn‚Äôt perform any logic. It just determines the structure of a website.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">On the other hand, languages like JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java, are all ‚Äúofficial‚Äù programming languages because they handle complex functionalities and interactivity. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> Some developers refer to anyone who codes in just HTML and CSS as a coder, and those who code in JavaScript, Java, C++, and other programming languages as programmers.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">So you could say that all programmers are coders, but not all coders are programmers. But not everyone feels this way, so it‚Äôs important to do your own research and learn the skills before you take a side üôÇ </p>
            <h2 class="py-4">Why Should You Learn How to Code?</h2>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">The world is becoming a global village. And coding is a big reason it‚Äôs happening.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">There are tons of reasons why you should learn how to code, and I will touch on some of them here.</p>
            <ol class="text-secondary py-2">
                <li>First of all, learning to code greatly enhances your analytical and problem-solving skills.</li>
                <li>Your earning potential increases: there are senior developers who make $400,000 a year. So by learning how to code, you can live out your dreams and become financially secure.</li>
                <li>You can work for the biggest tech companies: learning how to code open up doors for you to work at the biggest tech firms like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook. If you‚Äôre a fan of FAANG, you should definitely consider learning to code.</li>
                <li>You can work independently: a lot of developers have years of experience in their respective industries and have never worked for any other person or company as an employee. By working for yourself, you work on your own schedule, at your own pace, and on your own terms.</li>        
            </ol>
            <h2 class="py-4">How to Learn How to Code for Free</h2>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> As I pointed out earlier, there are tons of resources online for learning how to code. You can find any resource you want by searching on Google, but that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
            <h2 class="py-4">Learn to Code on YouTube</h2>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> YouTube has often been described as a free ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù. A lot of people have become software engineers, web developers, data analysts, database engineers, and administrators by watching YouTube videos and putting what they learn into practice.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> freeCodeCamp has a YouTube channel with over 1,000 videos on web development, data science, machine learning, freelancing, databases, and everything related to tech.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> In addition to the freeCodeCamp channel, there are lots of other great channels such as Traversy Media, NetNinja, WebDevSimplified, Florin Pop, AmigosCode, and a lot more.</p>
            <h2 class="py-4">Learn to Code with freeCodeCamp</h2>
            <img src="images/coding.webp"  alt="">
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">To narrow it down a little from Google searches and YouTube, freeCodeCamp is a great platform where you can learn how to code ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the best in the world, actually. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> And one of the best parts? You don‚Äôt have to pay anything to learn to code because freeCodeCamp is a non-profit and all of its resources are completely free to use.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> To get started with freeCodeCamp, you can log on to the curriculum website and sign up. Then you will get full access to the entire 3,000+ hour curriculum that can take you from zero to hero, novice to ninja, and beginner to expert in coding.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> Apart from the curriculum, freeCodeCamp has a solid presence on YouTube in English and Spanish, as I mentioned above.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">There is also a forum like StackOverflow where you can interact with fellow campers (that‚Äôs what freeCodeCamp users are called), ask questions, and get your coding issues resolved. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">And of course there‚Äôs freeCodeCamp‚Äôs publication, where you are now, that contains over 7,000 tutorials on a wide range of tech topics. </p>
            <h2 class="py-4">Learn to Code with the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)</h2>
            <img src="images/image.png" class="d-block w-100 py-3" alt="">
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> MDN has one of the largest collections of documentation for web technologies and APIs such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">If you are the type that likes to learn by reading, MDN is a great place to learn coding and web development. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">The beautiful thing about MDN is that the documentation is regularly updated and so you learn everything in a modern way. </p>
            <h2 class="py-4">Learn to Code with Sololearn</h2>
            <img src="images/sololearn.webp" alt="" class="w-100">
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">Sololearn is a social and interactive platform where you can learn any programming language and many of the popular frameworks and libraries. I used the platform myself while starting out, so I can testify to how helpful it is. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> The curriculum is not really the most attractive thing about Sololearn ‚Äì rather, it‚Äôs the community. Millions of people all around the world get to interact and brainstorm on coding, so you can ask questions openly and resolve your issues, post your projects, and get feedback.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> In addition, you get the chance to compete with other people in quizzes and send them direct messages.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2"> Sololearn is available in web and mobile versions. You can download the mobile app from the app store.</p>
