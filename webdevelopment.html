            <p class="text-secondary py-2">There are some great roadmaps for web developers out there. But some make you solve a “puzzle” before even getting started, as there are multiple choices that you have to make. </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">When I started to learn Web Development, I wished that I could find an experienced developer who would tell me what they had done to become a Web Developer. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anyone.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">Now that I’ve worked in the industry for 4 years, I want to share with you how I would start to learn Web Development in 2021. In this article, I will show you every step that you can take from a beginner to become a developer </p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">I will start with some Essential Tools that you should know, then cover the Programming Languages and Libraries/Frameworks that you need to learn to become a Front-end or a Full-stack Developer.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary py-2">I will also be talking about some example projects that you can build to practice your skills.</p>

      <div class="w-75">
        <h2>VS Code (or other code editor)</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">First, you should learn how to use Visual Studio Code, which is a source code editor. It is a free and powerful tool.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">In the beginning, I recommend learning some of the basic shortcuts and installing some of the extensions like ESlint, Prettier, or Live Server.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a free, full-length course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel to get you started.</p>

<section class="The Command Line py-5">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="w-75">
        <h2>The Command Line</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Next, you need to know about the Command-Line. You should learn what it is, and some of the basic commands like how to move around directories, how to create a new directory, or how to create a new file.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a great article on how to use Bash, the Linux command line. And here’s one one that’ll help you use the command line more effectively. </p>

<section class="Version Control – Git and GitHub py-5">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="w-75">
        <h2>Version Control – Git and GitHub</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">No matter what you do, as a developer, you need to know about Git. Git is a Version Control system used for tracking changes. It is usually used with GitHub, which is a code hosting platform.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">In the beginning, learning Git might be overwhelming, therefore you just need to know some of the basics like how to create a new Repository, how to clone a project, how to make a new commit, and how to pull and push the new changes.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">One of the best ways to practice Git is by working in a team. There, you need to know how to create a new branch, how to make pull requests, and how to resolve conflicts.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a great Git and GitHub crash course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel to get you going with version control.</p>

        <h2 class="py-4">Design tools – Figma</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">The last tool is Figma. Figma is a design tool and is free to use for individuals. But here I want to talk about how to use Figma as a developer.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">As a developer, you might get designs from designers on your team. With Figma you can inspect the code of the elements and measure the layout. Therefore, you need to know how to read Figma design, like how to get the color, typography, or spacing right.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s an article about various design tools, Figma included. And here’s a fun tutorial about creating 3D sketches in Figma.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Alright, so these are the tools that you need to know of when getting started. You don’t need to know everything, but be sure that you understand the basics so that you can improve while learning to code.</p>
        <h2 class="py-4">Programming Languages Web Developers Should Learn</h2>
        <img src="images/image.webp" alt=""> 
        <h2 class="py-1">HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Next, let’s continue with programming languages. And let’s start off by talking about Responsive Websites.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Responsive websites are sites that look good and are usable on all devices or screen sizes. You probably know how important it is to build a responsive website, as people use so many different devices these days.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">So let’s jump to the first two languages that you need to know to build a website: HTML and CSS</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It it is used to build the skeleton for your website. HTML is not difficult to learn, but you might want to pay more attention to HTML forms as they will be fundamental in the future.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This is a markup language but I also consider it to be a programming language. CSS is not necessarily difficult to learn but it’s difficult to master.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">There are few topics that you want to pay more attention to like:</p>
        <ul class="text-secondary">
            <li>Box model – how margins, padding, and borders work together.</li>
            <li>CSS units – used for expressing lengths (e.g: rem, vh, and vw).</li>
            <li>Position – specifies the type of positioning method. It also confuses many people so make sure you spend some time on it.</li>
            <li>Variables – or Custom properties are entities that can be reused throughout a document. This is my favorite feature in CSS. They make working with CSS so enjoyable and you can create themes with just a few lines of code.</li>
            <li>Media query – decides what to show on different screen sizes. They are a key component of responsive design.</li>
            <li>Animation – lets an element change from one style to another. If you know how to use animation correctly, it makes your site stand out. Otherwise, it will make your website look unprofessional, so be careful.</li>
            <li>Flexbox, CSS Grid – used for building Responsive layouts (I forgot to mention this in the video).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a full handbook that’ll teach you all the basics of HTML. And here’s a complete course on CSS on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel that’ll get you started beautifying your sites.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">When you know the basics of HTML and CSS, the next step is to build some basic websites. For example, you can try a Homepage, a Form like a login page or a checkout page. You can even build a Portfolio. You can find example projects on DevChallenges.io</p> 
        <h2 class="py-4">Website deployment</h2> 
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Once you have your website, you need to put it on the internet, so people can see it. Deployment is the process of deploying your code to a hosting platform.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Back in the day it was a lot more difficult to do. But now, it’s super easy and you can use tools like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a full YouTube course on how to get your site online that covers the entire process from start to finish</p>
        <h2 class="py-4">JavaScript – Fundamentals</h2> 
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Alright, the next topic is JavaScript. JavaScript is a popular programming language and is widely used for Web Development, among other things.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">You will need to learn some of the basic features of the language like Data Types, Loops, and Conditionals.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Then there are topics that you will want to dive deeper into.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">First, we have debugging. This is the process of finding and fixing errors. Here’s a great in-depth guide to bug squashing to get you started.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Then there are other topics like Objects, Primitives, and Arrays. Especially when working with Arrays, you need to know about Array methods as well.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Functions are the main building blocks in your program. So make sure that you don’t overlook them.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">One of my favorite features in JavaScript is de-structuring – it is easy to write and makes the language super powerful.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Like C#, Java, or other programming languages, in modern JavaScript we also have classes. These are useful when it comes to Object-Oriented Programming and the SOLID principles.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">And no matter how good you are with programming, you will have errors in your scripts. This means you’ll want to know about Error handling as well.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Asynchronous programming is important, especially when you need to communicate with the server. So spend some time learning about Promises and Async/Await</p>
        <h2 class="py-4">JavaScript – Browser</h2> 
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Let’s move on to how JavaScript is used in the browser.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">First, you need to know what a Document Object Model or DOM is. Then you need to know how to get elements, how to change the classes, or how to change the style with JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a good introduction to the JS DOM, and here’s a guide on how to manipulate the DOM (you’ll learn by building a project).</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">You also need to learn about different User Interface Events like click, mouse over, mouse down, and so on.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">And, you’ll also want to pay more attention to Forms in JavaScript as they have many events and properties</p>
        <h2 class="py-4">JavaScript – Other features</h2> 
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">The Fetch API is an important topic. It lets you send network requests to servers. This is useful, for example, when we need to submit a form or get a user’s information.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Another important topic is Storing Data in the browser. Here you need to know what the differences are between Cookies, LocalStorage, and sessionStorage.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Other less important topics when you are just getting started are Regular expressions, Web Components, and Websockets.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Regular expressions are used to search and replace text. Web Components, are a new thing but you should totally check them out.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Lastly, we have Websockets. They are useful when you need to have continuous data exchanges like in chat applications.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">So after learning Javascript, you might want to spend some time to learn about TypeScript. I love TypeScript as it gives me a safe feeling while writing code.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">TypeScript provides static typing, that allows you to catch errors earlier in the debugging process. It also saves your time as it finds bugs before the code runs</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Here’s a helpful post on TypeScript types to help you think about them the right way.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">You can stop here and start working on some projects. But personally, I would continue by learning at least one framework. Then you can practice JavaScript at the same time.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary py-2">Alright, so let’s move on.</p>
